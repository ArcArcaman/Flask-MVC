##### MVC template for python Flask microframework with lightweight microservice tools.

[Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) microframework is a very powerful server framework but it gets messy when files are placed in one python file. In **Flask-MVC**, we create simple configurations and and provide organized structure to ease and systemize the Flask project you are making. We based on the popular MVC pattern to organize our files. 

**Flask-MVC** also provides a simple microservice architecture tools which allow you to use names to reference a specific IP and Port. (Docker and Kubernetes maybe included in future improvement.)
